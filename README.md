Welcome, everyone! 

This is a minimal draft of the book 'Advanced Geospatial Data Analysis' based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (Link will update later). 

This template provides a skeleton file structure that we can work on editing and changing the content. 

The contents inside the .Rmd files provide some pointers to help you get started, but feel free to also delete the content in each file and start fresh.
